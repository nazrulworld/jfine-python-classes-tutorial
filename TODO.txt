Things TODO (no surprisingly).


# From construct.rst.

Why inherit from object?

What is a dictproxy?

What is the MRO?

Which objects don't have a dictionary? (An instance of a class that
has __slots__.)

What is an attribute?

Add A.__name__.


# From deconstruct.rst

Note the funny occurence of '__builtin__'.

In Sphinx subclass string to get name of module right (or at least
better).
