Things TODO (no surprisingly).


# From construct.rst.

Why inherit from object?

What is a dictproxy?

What is the MRO?

Which objects don't have a dictionary? (An instance of a class that
has __slots__.)

What is an attribute?

Add A.__name__.


# From deconstruct.rst

Note the funny occurence of '__builtin__'.

In Sphinx subclass string to get name of module right (or at least
better).

Why we need __func__ in:

>>> get_body(B) == dict(s='a string', f=B.f.__func__)


In Jython empty class dict has no __doc__.

# Elsewhere

getattr
setattr

consistency: doc-string, not docstring.

-OO and property(doc='doc string')
