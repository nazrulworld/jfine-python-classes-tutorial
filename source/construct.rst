Constructing classes
====================

There are two basic ways of constructing classes in Python.  The best
known way is to use Python's :keyword:`class` keyword.  The other way
is to use Python's :func:`type` function.  This page covers the
keyword way. :doc:`using-type` is more powerful and sometimes more
convenient.  However, the keyword approach is the better way to get
started and in ordinary programming is the most convenient.
